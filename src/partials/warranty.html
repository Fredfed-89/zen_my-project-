          ZEN cards have a very neat feature that will help you whenever your electronic devices start failing after the
          standard warranty ends, which is pretty common.
        </p>
        <p class="warranty__text-bottom">
          When you buy any electronics with your ZEN shopping MastercardÂ®, their warranty gets extended by one year. How
          does it work? It simply does. Automatically.
